The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected results when styles from different selectors conflict.  For instance, a highly specific selector might override a more general one, even if the general one appears later in the stylesheet. This can be difficult to debug if you're not aware of the specificity rules.  Another less obvious issue can arise with the cascade order of styles. Styles declared later in the stylesheet might not override earlier declarations if they have the same specificity.
